    "einartoft_desc": "The home of the first varl king, Einar, who carved his empire into the crook of the Brattabreck and Wyrmscale mountains. The varl fortress, hewn into the rock itself, eclipses all but the greater accomplishments in the north.",

    "fiskivik_desc": "With Ongullstadr growing rapidly, many of the fishermen elected to move their business to the other side of the bay.

    "fladdavalorplains_desc": "In the first great war, men and varl clashed most frequently here in the open fields of the Fladdavalor Plains.

    "frozentombs_desc": "Off the coast of the Silverstone are a series of massive, evenly-spaced glaciers, visible from Skrymirstead, which the varl king Skrymir fancied to shape as fitting tombs for himself and his peers.

    "frozentombs_name": "The Frozen Tombs",
    "gardstad_desc": "Though Gardstad has been around for many generations, not many people know it exists, largely because the families live a modest life of seclusion. Fittingly, the residents of Gardstad are barely aware of the outside world, most of whom will never see a varl or a mender in their lifetime.",
    "gardstad_name": "Gardstad",
    "gaular_desc": "The humble appearance of Gaular, a smallish town of woodsmen along the Fingernail, hides the fact that it exists as a town for prisoners who have been exiled from the capital of Arberrang, forced into servitude where they are either made to harvest lumber or sent to break stones in Brunthal.",
    "gaular_name": "Gaular",
    "gelmsfjord_desc": "On the other side of the Fork stands Gelmsfjord, which is only notable in that it's the one location on the Silverstone that doesn't have some kind of absurd or tragic story attached to it about the varl during the reign of Skrymir.",
    "gelmsfjord_name": "Gelmsfjord",
    "gimfellpeak_desc": "Though the Sky Irons continue further north, Gimfell Peak is generally recognized as the northmost point of the Wyrmscale Mountains, and certainly the tallest.

    "graysteps_desc": "Much like the Sweinnsfeed, Gray Steps stubbornly refuses to be cultivated, and there are several local myths about why this is, though the most prevalent one is that the bodies of murder victims from Boersgard or other nearby towns have been concealed here and their furious spirits deny any life to grow.",
    "graysteps_name": "Gray Steps",
    "graywatersea_desc": "While the Gruin Sea may be a miserable body of water, at least it is not literally gray. The same cannot be said of the Graywater Sea, which, ringed in most directions by swamp marsh, is a nearly motionless stew of gray sludge.",

    "grenilund_name": "Grenilund",
    "greyhorn_desc": "Though the dredge infrequently appear so far to the east, Greyhorn has been an important tower due to the low-lying fogs that regularly cover the ground in this region.

    "greyhorn_name": "Greyhorn",
    "grofheim_desc": "The last home of the varl, and seat of their power, founded by Arnfinnr, the second varl king. Though the varl have moved around a lot, most consider Grofheim their capital.

    "grofheim_name": "Grofheim",
    "gruinsea_desc": "Of all the water passages, the Gruin Sea is least well known. Seafarers may spend one day nauseous from the stench and another stuck in ruddy shallows, weeks away from anywhere worth going. In short, there is no practical reason to journey here.",
    "gruinsea_name": "Gruin Sea",
    "grundar_desc": "Nobody knows exactly who founded Grundar, though most speculate it was an early horseborn settlement, seeing as how it's in the middle of nowhere, and close to no other landmarks or valuable terrain. The people here tend fields but walk great distances just to gather water.",
    "grundar_name": "Grundar",
    "gunrsheog_desc": "A varl named Gunr was the first to discover this series of low-lying hills in the Wyrmscale foothills that look eerily similar to barrows and go on for days. Rumor has it that all manner of creatures have been buried in this massive grave, though the hill or two that have been dug up unearthed nothing of note.",
    "gunrsheog_name": "Gunr's Heog",
    "halsar_desc": "A town build into the side of a canyon, Halsar suffers from the occasional rockslide but makes up for it with a thriving trade, fishing and agricultural business, managing to do business with both the east and west coasts, as well as controlling any traffic that might be wanting to cross the continent.",
    "halsar_name": "Halsar",
    "haukstorp_desc": "From atop a high hill, Haukstorp is named for the many hawks that circle past the tall pines and the loft they sit in that lets them see down into the valley toward Boersgard.

    "haukstorp_name": "Haukstorp",
    "highpass_desc": "A reluctantly formed road once travellers discovered that the Summer Path would often be completely blocked in the winter. It takes travelers the long way around Haukstorp, which has been good for Haukstorp's economy and nobody else.",

    "thevarlsmarch_desc": "The Varlsmarch, cradle of Grofheim, is named such for the belief that each varl of worth buried in King's Barrow becomes the bones of the mountains, eventually forming a new peak along the range.

    "tinsfount_name": "Tinsfount",
    "tistel_desc": "Deep in the overgrown thickets, early explorers found odd patches of prickly plants; miserable, stinging and clawing barbs that left a rash and a fever.

    "tistel_name": "Tistel",
    "tolir_desc": "When Arberrang became a city overpopulated and over-popular, the up and coming rich and important families had two choices: join in the game of politics, or leave. Those looking for a more idyllic life settled nearby, in Tolir.",

    "twospears_desc": "An unusual gap in the Varlsmarch mountains look like two great spears at a gate.

    "twospears_name": "Two Spears",
    "valkajokull_desc": "At the great war's end, it was the Valka, the first menders, who pushed the dredge so far into the north that they were no longer a threat. Some believe the Valka committed a genocide of an unfathomable magnitude, others believe the dredge were forced to return underground, for not even they could survive these bleak, lifeless ice plains. In any case, if the dredge could be said to inhabit any lands, it is those named after their vanquishers.",

    "vedrfell_desc": "Named &quot;bad weather&quot;, the gales that blow in from the bay and around the mountain peaks keep Vedrfell in a generally unpleasant state.

    "vedrfell_name": "Vedrfell",
    "vetursea_desc": "The Winter Sea in the north strikes a precarious balance between frozen and traversable but fast moving flows usually keep it from icing over completely.

    "waterspirit_desc": "While land has plenty of myths of its own, nothing seems to stick in the imagination like water. Lost longships, illusions, madness and the terror of the unknown all start in the waters, and if the gods are not involved, it must be the spirits.",
    "waterspirit_name": "Spirits of the Water",
    "waywardlake_desc": "Wayward Lake has remained somewhat protected ever since the population of Boersgard harvested Deepmot for all it's worth, though this was largely due to the protectiveness displayed by the residents of Aros, who quickly asserted their ownership.",
    "waywardlake_name": "Wayward Lake",
    "weaverseye_desc": "Not many could tell you the name of this remote hunk of ice, and of those who can it is debatable whether it refers to the eye of a needle or the loss of sight that comes along with the blinding ice.",

    "whithagr_desc": "If Akur is known for being the most fertile farms in the human lands, Whithagr has at least put a stranglehold on the wheat trade, though most merchants consider the two cities essentially the same bit of ground.",
    "whithagr_name": "Whithagr",
    "wolvesmaw_desc": "While wolves can be found throughout Lang Loom Forest, it was their tendency to congregate in the southern half that earned the forest its name and reputation.

    "wolvesmaw_name": "Wolves Maw",
    "wordan_desc": "There is something deeply unsettling about the island at the top of the world called Wordan, and those who have dared to travel here say they left almost immediately, not because of something they discovered, but for the unearthly sounds they did not wish to discover the source of.",

    "wyrmscalemountains_desc": "The land's longest range of mountains, it was observed, resembled something like the spine of an impossibly large wyrm, each of its numerous peaks just one of many invincible scales.

    "wyrmstearisle_desc": "A sizable chunk of land floating off the east coast, though many would prefer to use the word oozing. The thick, muddy waters surrounding the isle were named not after sightings of great wyrms so much as the abundant nests of venomous water snakes that can be found here.
